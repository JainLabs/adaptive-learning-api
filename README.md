What is Radioactive?
======================
Radioactive is an Mobile HTML5 application in PHP for adaptive learning.

Why  HTML5/CSS3
===============
This app is deployed to Android and coming soon to iOS. It also works on WP7, BlackBerry and other platforms that support HTML5 and CSS4.

The UI is made in jQuery Mobile for compatability.

Installation/Setup
==================
1. Create a database `radioactive`
2. Import the SQL contained in the folder `sql`
3. Create a file above the root folder called `dbinfo.dat`. if you have a different database configuration than localhost/root/no password, make a file `dbinfo.dat` above the root directory for this code with the contents: 
`{"server":"mysql_server","database":"radioactive","username":"mysql_username","password":"mysql_password"}`
4. Test it by going to `iostestframe.html`. This will also give you a feel for what the application feels like on a mobile browser.
